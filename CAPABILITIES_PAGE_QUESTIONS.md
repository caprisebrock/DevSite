# Capabilities Page - Questions to Answer

## 🎯 Goal
This page should make $10k-50k clients think: "These people can build ANYTHING I need."

---

## ❓ Questions I Need Answered

### **1. WHO ARE YOU? (Origin Story)**

Quick background to establish credibility:

- [ ] How long have you been building software? (Years of experience)
- [ ] What's your background? (Self-taught, bootcamp, CS degree, previous jobs?)
- [ ] Are you solo or do you have a team/partners?
- [ ] What made you start doing high-value custom development?
- [ ] Any impressive past work (companies you've worked for, projects at scale)?

**Example answer:**
> "I'm a full-stack developer with 5+ years building enterprise software. Started at [Company], built systems serving 100k+ users. Now focusing on custom development for businesses with complex needs."

---

### **2. WHAT CAN YOU ACTUALLY BUILD? (Real Capabilities)**

Be honest - what are you GREAT at vs. what you can learn:

**Core Strengths:**
- [ ] Frontend frameworks? (Next.js, React - clearly yes)
- [ ] Backend systems? (Node.js, PostgreSQL, APIs)
- [ ] AI integration? (OpenAI, Claude, LangChain - you mentioned this)
- [ ] Database design? (PostgreSQL, Prisma)
- [ ] Real-time features? (WebSockets, live data)
- [ ] Payment systems? (Stripe, payment processing)
- [ ] Authentication? (Custom auth, OAuth, SSO)
- [ ] Video/WebRTC? (You mentioned video platforms)
- [ ] Mobile? (React Native, or just web?)

**Can Learn/Build With:**
- [ ] What can you figure out with AI/vibe coding?
- [ ] What would you NOT take on? (Native iOS? Blockchain? ML from scratch?)

---

### **3. PRICING STRATEGY (Need to Align This)**

You mentioned conflicting prices:
- Site like this: $1k-3k
- Positioning doc says: $10k-50k projects

**Let's clarify:**

**Simple Sites/Apps ($1k-5k):**
- Marketing sites
- Simple dashboards
- Basic CRUD apps
- Portfolio sites
- Landing pages

**Medium Projects ($5k-15k):**
- Custom admin panels
- SaaS MVPs
- Integration projects
- Basic AI tools

**Complex Projects ($15k-50k):**
- Multi-tenant SaaS
- Advanced AI systems
- Enterprise integrations
- Video platforms
- Complex workflows

**Question:** What's your ACTUAL sweet spot?
- [ ] Are you targeting $10k-50k clients? (positioning doc)
- [ ] Or $1k-5k projects? (what you just said)
- [ ] Or BOTH with tiered offerings?

**My suggestion:** Position for $10k-50k, offer smaller projects as "foot in the door"

---

### **4. GUARANTEES & RISK REVERSAL**

You mentioned:
> "If we can't do it, money back on the $150 call"

**Questions:**
- [ ] What's your ACTUAL guarantee? (Money back if you can't deliver? Fixed price?)
- [ ] How do you handle scope changes?
- [ ] What happens if client doesn't like the result?
- [ ] Do you offer revisions? How many?
- [ ] Post-launch support? (30 days? 90 days?)

---

### **5. "NOT A FIT" FILTERING**

From positioning strategy, you DON'T want:
- ❌ $500 website clients
- ❌ "I need it tomorrow"
- ❌ Template customization

**But what ELSE are you NOT a fit for?**
- [ ] Native mobile apps? (iOS/Android without React Native?)
- [ ] DevOps/infrastructure? (AWS setup, Kubernetes?)
- [ ] Game development?
- [ ] Blockchain/Web3?
- [ ] Pure design (no code)?

---

### **6. PROCESS & TIMELINE**

How do you actually work?

- [ ] Discovery call → What happens?
- [ ] How do you scope projects?
- [ ] What's your typical timeline? (8-12 weeks mentioned)
- [ ] How often do you communicate with clients?
- [ ] Do you use Agile? Sprints? Weekly updates?
- [ ] What tools do you use? (Figma? Linear? Notion?)

---

### **7. TEAM & CAPACITY**

- [ ] Are you solo or team?
- [ ] How many projects can you take on at once?
- [ ] Do you have designers? Or just dev?
- [ ] Do you partner with anyone? (Designers, other devs, agencies?)

---

### **8. LEGAL & COMPLIANCE (Important!)**

You said:
> "We can't offer SOC 2 compliance (not licensed)"

**Let's be clear about what you CAN vs. CANNOT do:**

**CAN DO:**
- ✅ Build secure, encrypted systems
- ✅ Follow SOC 2 best practices
- ✅ Help clients prepare for SOC 2 audit
- ✅ Document security measures
- ✅ HIPAA-ready architecture (not certification)

**CANNOT DO:**
- ❌ Provide SOC 2 certification (that's an auditor's job)
- ❌ Legal compliance consulting (not lawyers)
- ❌ HIPAA certification (you can build HIPAA-ready, not certify)

**Question:** What should we say on the site?
- [ ] "SOC 2-ready development" (YES)
- [ ] "We are SOC 2 compliant" (NO - misleading)
- [ ] "Security-first architecture" (YES)

---

### **9. WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT?**

Why should clients pick YOU over:
- Upwork/Fiverr developers ($50/hr)
- Web design agencies ($5k sites)
- Large dev shops ($100k+ projects)
- Offshore teams ($20/hr)

**Your unique advantages:**
- [ ] Speed? (You built this site in 2-3 hours)
- [ ] AI-powered development? (Vibe coding = faster?)
- [ ] Full-stack so no handoffs?
- [ ] Modern stack? (Next.js, TypeScript)
- [ ] Direct access to senior dev? (No project managers)
- [ ] Flexible? (Can pivot quickly)

---

### **10. SOCIAL PROOF (Do You Have Any?)**

- [ ] Testimonials from past clients?
- [ ] Case studies with results?
- [ ] Companies you've worked with?
- [ ] Open source contributions?
- [ ] LinkedIn recommendations?
- [ ] Previous employment at known companies?

---

## 🎯 Quick Answers Needed to Build This:

**Just answer these 3 and I can start:**

1. **Who are you?** (1-2 sentences - experience, background)
2. **What's your pricing?** ($10k-50k? Or smaller projects too?)
3. **Team or solo?** (Just you? Partners? Contractors?)

Then I'll build a killer Capabilities page with placeholders for the rest!
