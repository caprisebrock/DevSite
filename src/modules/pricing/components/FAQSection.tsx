    question: 'Do you only take brand-new builds?',
    answer:
      'No. We join at any stage: new builds, fragile MVP stabilization, AI-generated codebase cleanup, and targeted support (deployments, Supabase, Stripe, integrations, debugging).',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you use AI without creating messy code?',
    answer:
      'AI accelerates implementation, but every release goes through engineering review. We verify architecture, type safety, lint/build checks, and integration behavior before handoff.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is pricing decided?',
    answer:
      'Pricing is milestone-based. After intake, we scope the first deliverable clearly and quote that milestone. Additional layers (payments, observability, compliance, enterprise integration) are added only when needed.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does release-ready mean for you?',
    answer:
      'Readable structure, passing TypeScript/lint/build checks, stable deployment flow, and validation of auth, error handling, and integration behavior before release.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if my codebase is messy or half-finished?',
    answer:
      'That is common. We start by reproducing issues, tracing architecture and integrations, then applying focused fixes in controlled steps with clear notes on what changed.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you work hourly or fixed-price?',
    answer:
      'Mostly milestone-based fixed pricing. If a project needs ongoing support after the first scope, we can also structure recurring feature work.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do we start?',
    answer:
      'Send your repo, live URL, screenshots, or a short brief. We identify the safest first milestone and recommend the clearest path forward.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I see examples of your work?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Review our project case studies for architecture details, integration scope, and delivery outcomes across SaaS, document automation, AI workflows, and internal tools.',
  },
