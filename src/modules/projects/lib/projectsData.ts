    subtitle: 'Municipal Bond Deal Execution Platform — An App Full of Apps',
    category: 'Enterprise',
    description:
      'A modular enterprise platform for managing municipal bond transactions end-to-end. Organized as a host app containing 22 feature modules — each a distinct workflow: deal creation, contacts and team management, collaborative term sheets with version history, closing document assembly, in-app messaging, a real-time notification system, a per-deal email inbox, and an interactive US issuers directory with geographic drill-down.',
    challenge:
      'Municipal bond deals involve dozens of parties — bond counsel, underwriters, trustees, fiscal agents, issuers — coordinating across fragmented email threads, Word documents, and spreadsheets. Each deal is legally distinct, requires versioned documentation, and involves sensitive financial data. The platform needed to feel like a product, not a collection of admin screens, while enforcing the strict access control and audit requirements of public finance.',
