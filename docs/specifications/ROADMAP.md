## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Content not ready  
**Solution:** Use realistic placeholders, launch with 3 projects minimum

**Issue:** Design takes too long  
**Solution:** Stick to design system, avoid custom one-offs

**Issue:** Scope creep  
**Solution:** Launch MVP, iterate based on real feedback

**Issue:** Low conversions  
**Solution:** A/B test CTAs, improve copy, add social proof

---

## Decision Points

### To Decide Before Building:
1. ✅ Tech stack (Next.js 14 - APPROVED)
2. ✅ Color scheme (Cyan/Purple - APPROVED)
3. ✅ Design system (Soft Sharp - APPROVED)
4. ⏳ **Company name/branding**
5. ⏳ **Hero headline copy**
6. ⏳ **Initial 3-6 projects to showcase**
7. ⏳ **Service descriptions/positioning**
8. ⏳ **Pricing strategy (transparent vs. hidden)**
9. ⏳ **Paid consultation price ($150 suggested)**
10. ⏳ **Domain name**

---

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Get decisions on pending items above** (company name, hero copy, etc.)
2. **List 3-6 projects** to feature (names, descriptions, tech stacks)
3. **Initialize repo** with proper tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Husky)
4. **Build homepage hero** → get feedback → iterate
5. **Build services section** → validate messaging
6. **Create first project case study** → template for others
7. **Launch MVP** → start getting traffic → optimize

---

## Notes

- **Keep it lean:** Don't add features "just because"
- **Content first:** Great copy > fancy animations
- **Mobile matters:** 60%+ of traffic will be mobile
- **Fast ships win:** Better to launch and iterate than perfect in private
- **Measure everything:** Can't improve what you don't measure

**Remember:** This site's job is to book $150 strategy calls with qualified $10k+ leads. Every design decision should support that goal.
