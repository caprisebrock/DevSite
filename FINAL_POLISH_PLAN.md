# Final 5-10% Polish Plan - Day One Labs

**Date:** Dec 11, 2024  
**Status:** Site 95% complete, focusing on demos & projects to build credibility

---

## ✅ What's Working Great

### Pricing/Messaging
The current pricing structure is **clear and consistent**:
- **MVP Launch:** $10k-15k, 1-2 weeks
- **Full Product Build:** $18k-35k, 2-4 weeks  
- **Ongoing Partnership:** $8k-12k/month

**Location:** `ServicesSection.tsx` on homepage

**My Take:** This looks good! But if there's something specific that feels "off", we can adjust. Options:
- Move pricing to a dedicated pricing page (you already have `/pricing`)
- Adjust the language/framing
- Change the pricing tiers

---

## 🎯 Core Goal: Credibility Through Demos & Projects

Instead of recording "vibe coding" sessions, we're focusing on:

### **3 DEMO PROJECTS** 
Interactive, live demos that showcase:
- Clean business logic
- AI integration
- Modern UI/UX
- Your speed & capability

### **3 REAL PROJECTS**
Full-depth portfolio pieces that show:
- Routing and navigation
- Complex architecture
- Real-world problem solving
- Production-grade code

## ❓ Questions to Answer

1. **Pricing Section:** What specifically feels "off"? Should we:
   - Adjust the language?
   - Change the tiers?
   - Move to a different location?
   - Add more detail?

2. **Demos Priority:** Which demo should I build first?
   - AI Product Fit (useful for business)
   - CSV Visualizer (impressive visuals)
   - Text Summarizer (dead simple)

3. **Real Projects:** Do you have ANY existing code I can:
   - Clean up and showcase?
   - Build upon?
   - Use as inspiration?

4. **Timeline:** What's your deadline?
   - Launch by end of month (Dec 31)?

## 🎯 What I'll Do Right Now

Unless you tell me otherwise, I'm going to:

1. **Build Demo #1: AI Product Fit Analyzer**
   - Route: `/app/demos/product-fit/page.tsx`
   - API: `/app/api/analyze-fit/route.ts`
   - Time: Rest of today

2. **Update Homepage** to feature it
3. **Test & Deploy** to Vercel

Then tomorrow:
4. **Build Demo #2: CSV Data Visualizer**
5. **Build Demo #3: AI Text Summarizer**

By end of week, you'll have 3 live, impressive demos.
