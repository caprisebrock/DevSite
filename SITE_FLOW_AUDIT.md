---

### **Path 1: How We Build** (`/how-we-build`)

**Purpose:** Explain the multi-agent advantage without sounding defensive

**Hero:**
> "We Don't Build Like Traditional Developers"
> 
> We orchestrate specialized AI agents that build in parallel — architecture, UI, API, 
> testing — all working from shared context. Then we review, refine, and ship production-grade code.

**Multi-Agent Orchestra:**
- 6 specialized agents explained (Architecture, Frontend, Backend, Security, Testing, Documentation)
- Comparison: Traditional (10-12 weeks sequential) vs. Day One (7-14 days parallel)
- Context Passport explanation (shared understanding keeps agents aligned)

**Process Timeline:**
- Day 1: Discovery + Context Engineering
- Day 2-3: Multi-agent build (parallel)
- Day 4-5: Human review + refinement
- Day 6-7: Deploy + handoff
- Day 8-30: Post-launch support

**Proof Section:**
- Placeholder: Voice agent demo video (you mentioned this)
- Placeholder: Code quality walkthrough
- Real results: This site (2-3 hours), AI CRM (11 days), Document platform (8 days)

**Flow Check:** ✅ Explains HOW without being defensive. Positions parallel work as advantage. No overpromising.

---

### **Path 2: Projects** (`/projects`)

**Current State:**
- Featured projects with timeline emphasis ("Built in X Days")
- Challenge/Solution/Results format
- Tech stack + scope shown

**What's Working:**
- Timeline badges give proof of speed
- "Before Day One" context shows what they tried first
- Real results (raised funding, got customers, saved time)

**What's Missing:**
- No full Projects page built yet (just homepage preview)
- No project detail pages
- No filtering by timeline/category
- Placeholders for images

**Recommendation for Projects Page:**
```
[HERO]
Built Fast, Built Right
Real projects, real timelines, real results.

[FILTER BAR]
All | Built in <1 Week | Built in 1-2 Weeks | Built in 2-4 Weeks | Enterprise

[PROJECT GRID]
Each card shows:
- Timeline badge ("Built in 11 Days")
- Category (SaaS, AI, Automation)
- Title + brief description
- "Before Day One" context
- Results (raised $X, saved Y hours, Z customers)
- Tech stack
- View Case Study CTA

[CTA]
Your Project Could Be Next
[Book Discovery Call]
```

**Flow Check:** ⚠️ Needs work. Projects page doesn't exist yet beyond homepage preview.

---

### **Path 3: Pricing** (`/pricing`)

**Purpose:** Be transparent about cost + timelines, filter bad leads

**Hero:**
> "Simple, Honest Pricing Based on Complexity"
> 
> We build fast. But projects take time for other reasons — discovery, iteration, 
> integrations, testing. Here's the honest breakdown.

**Three Tiers:**
1. Starter Build ($8k-12k, 1-2 weeks) - MVPs, internal tools
2. Production Build ($15k-30k, 2-4 weeks) ⭐ Most Popular - Go to market ready
3. Enterprise Build ($30k-60k+, 4-8 weeks) - Multi-tenant, compliance, scale

**Timeline Breakdown (What Actually Takes Time):**
- Discovery: 20-30%
- **The Actual Building: 30-40%** ← Your advantage highlighted
- Iteration Cycles: 15-25%
- Integration Setup: 10-20%
- Testing & Polish: 10-15%
- Compliance (if enterprise): 0-30%

**Key Message:** "We're transparent: The coding is the fast part."

**FAQ (8 questions):**
- Why 2-4 weeks if you build fast?
- Can you build faster?
- Proof of concept option?
- Is code actually good?
- Changes after launch?
- Hourly or fixed-price?
- What if not a fit?
- Can I see examples?

**CTA:** "Not Sure Which Tier? Let's Figure It Out Together" - Discovery call

**Flow Check:** ✅ Perfect. Sets realistic expectations, filters bad leads, builds trust through transparency.

## 🔍 COHERENCE AUDIT

### **✅ What's Consistent Across All Pages:**

1. **Multi-agent messaging** - Every page mentions it
2. **Speed as benefit, not only hook** - Mentioned but not hammered
3. **Production-ready emphasis** - Quality is guaranteed
4. **Free discovery call** - No paid friction
5. **Fixed-price transparency** - No hourly surprises
6. **You own everything** - Repeated trust signal
7. **Honest about timelines** - 7-14 days typical, depends on scope

### **❌ Gaps in the Flow:**

1. **Projects page doesn't exist yet**
   - Homepage shows 3 featured projects
   - "See All Projects" button links to `/projects`
   - But `/projects` page is just a placeholder (old content)
   - **Fix:** Need to build full projects page with filtering

2. **Capabilities page still exists but not linked**
   - Lives at `/capabilities` but removed from nav
   - Content is generic/old positioning
   - **Options:** Delete it OR repurpose as "Demos" page

3. **Demo placeholders everywhere**
   - How We Build: "Coming soon: Voice agent demo"
   - How We Build: "Coming soon: Code walkthrough"
   - Projects: Placeholder images
   - **Fix:** Either build real demos OR remove placeholders

4. **CTA consistency**
   - Homepage: "Book Free Discovery Call"
   - How We Build: "Book Discovery Call"
   - Pricing: "Book Discovery Call"
   - **Good, but:** Button doesn't actually work yet (needs Cal.com)

5. **Messaging slight inconsistency:**
   - Homepage hero: "7-14 days"
   - Services: "Typical: 1-2 weeks"
   - Pricing: "1-2 weeks typical" / "2-4 weeks" / "4-8 weeks"
   - **This is fine** - different contexts, but could be tighter

## 🛠️ WHAT NEEDS TO BE BUILT/FIXED

### **Priority 1: Projects Page** (High Impact)

**Current State:** 
- Route exists at `/app/projects/page.tsx`
- Re-exports from `@/modules/projects`
- Module has ProjectCard component but page is probably old content

**What to Build:**
- Full projects page with filtering
- Use the 3 featured projects as starting data
- Add filter: All / Built in <1 Week / 1-2 Weeks / 2-4 Weeks / Enterprise
- Each card shows timeline badge prominently
- "See All Projects" from homepage should land here

**Implementation:**
- Update `src/modules/projects/index.tsx`
- Update `src/modules/projects/lib/projectsData.ts`
- Reuse ProjectCard component with timeline emphasis

---

### **Priority 2: Fix "See How We Build" Button** (Homepage)

**Current:** Homepage secondary CTA says "See How We Build" but might not be wired

**Fix:** Make sure it links to `/how-we-build`

---

### **Priority 3: Capabilities Page Decision**

**Options:**

**A. Delete it entirely**
- Not linked in nav anymore
- Content is generic
- Everything important is on "How We Build" now

**B. Repurpose as "Demos" page**
- Rename to `/demos`
- Showcase: Voice agent, code samples, architecture examples
- Link from "How We Build" page

**C. Leave it as hidden page**
- Some people might have direct link
- Can refine later

**Recommendation:** Option A (delete) or Option C (leave for now). Don't spend time on it yet.

---

### **Priority 4: Demo Content** (Future)

**Placeholders to fill:**
- Voice agent video (you mentioned recording this)
- Code walkthrough (GitHub links or video)
- Live build time-lapse
- Architecture diagrams

**For Now:** Placeholders are fine. Shows you're building in public.

---

## 📊 MESSAGING COHERENCE CHECK

### **Core Message (Should Be Same Everywhere):**

**What Day One Labs Is:**
> AI-accelerated product engineering lab that orchestrates specialized agents 
> to build production software in 7-14 days typical (depends on scope).

**The Differentiator:**
> Multi-agent orchestration (parallel work) + senior engineer review = 
> same quality, faster delivery, transparent pricing.

**The Process:**
> Discovery → Context Passport → Multi-agent build → Human review → Deploy

**The Promise:**
> Production-ready code, full ownership, honest timelines, no hourly surprises.

### **Where It's Consistent:**

✅ Homepage: "Build in days, not months" + "AI orchestration" + "10x faster"
✅ How We Build: Multi-agent explanation + process timeline + honest about review
✅ Pricing: Transparent tiers + timeline breakdown + "coding is fast part"
✅ All pages: Free discovery call, you own everything, fixed price

### **Where It Could Be Tighter:**

⚠️ **Timeline Language:**
- Homepage: "7-14 days"
- Services: "Typical: 1-2 weeks"
- Pricing tiers: "1-2 weeks" / "2-4 weeks" / "4-8 weeks"

**Fix:** Just pick one consistent range for each tier and use everywhere.

**Suggestion:**
- Simple/Starter: "1-2 weeks typical"
- Production: "2-4 weeks typical"
- Enterprise: "4-8 weeks typical"
- Use these EXACT phrases everywhere

⚠️ **Pricing Ranges:**
- Services section: $10k-15k / $18k-35k / $8k-12k
- Pricing page: $8k-12k / $15k-30k / $30k-60k

**These are slightly different.** Decide which is right and unify.

---

## 🎨 UI/UX COHERENCE CHECK

### **Design System:**

✅ **Colors:** Consistent cyan/purple throughout
✅ **Animations:** Same motion variants (fade in, slide up, hover lift)
✅ **Typography:** Same heading sizes, font weights
✅ **Spacing:** Consistent section padding (py-24 md:py-32)
✅ **Card styles:** Same border/hover/glow effects
✅ **CTAs:** Same button styles (primary = gradient, secondary = border)

**No issues here. Design is cohesive.**

### **Navigation Flow:**

✅ **Clear path:** Home → How We Build → Projects → Pricing
✅ **CTA consistency:** Every page has discovery call CTA
✅ **Footer links:** Same nav structure reflected

**One enhancement:** Add breadcrumbs or "Back to Home" on deep pages (optional)
