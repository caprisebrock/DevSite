## 📱 Social Media Strategy (Pre-Company Phase)

### **Recommended Approach: Hybrid Personal + Business**

Since you're not officially a company yet, but want to attend events and network:

#### **Primary Accounts (Create These Now):**

1. **LinkedIn - Personal Profile**
   - **Why:** Best for B2B networking, client discovery, events
   - **Name:** Your real name + "Full-Stack Developer" or "Software Architect"
   - **Profile:** Showcase your projects, link to portfolio
   - **Post:** Share project launches, tech insights, wins
   - **URL:** `linkedin.com/in/your-name`
   - **For QR codes:** ✅ Yes - professional, expected at events

2. **GitHub - Business/Professional**
   - **Why:** Shows code quality, open source contributions, credibility
   - **Name:** Your company name or personal brand
   - **Profile:** Pin best projects, showcase tech stack
   - **URL:** `github.com/your-company` or `github.com/your-name`
   - **For QR codes:** ✅ Yes - especially for developer clients

3. **Email - Business-Style (Even if Free)**
   - **Options:**
     - Personal domain: `hello@yourname.com` (buy domain for $12/year)
     - Gmail with business name: `yourbusinessname@gmail.com`
     - Temporary: `contact.yourname@gmail.com`
   - **Why:** Looks professional on cards/site
   - **For QR codes:** ✅ Yes - always include

#### **Optional (Add Later When Scaling):**

4. **Twitter/X - Personal Tech Account**
   - **Why:** Share quick wins, engage with dev community, thought leadership
   - **Name:** @yourname or @yourbiz
   - **Only if:** You'll actually post 2-3x/week

5. **Instagram - Visual Portfolio (Low Priority)**
   - **Why:** Show behind-the-scenes, design work, culture
   - **Only if:** You have visual content to share

6. **YouTube/TikTok (Future)**
   - **Why:** Tutorials, project walkthroughs, brand building
   - **Only if:** You want to invest in video content

## 📧 Email Strategy (No Company Yet)

### **Option 1: Buy Domain + Use Free Email (Recommended)**
```
Cost: $12/year for domain
Email: hello@yourdomain.com (using Gmail/Outlook for free)
Benefits: Professional, flexible, you own it
Setup: 10 minutes
```

### **Option 2: Professional Gmail**
```
Cost: Free
Email: yourbusinessname@gmail.com
Benefits: Easy, works immediately
Drawback: Not as professional
```

### **Option 3: Wait Until Official**
```
Cost: $0
Email: Use personal email with business signature
Temporary until company launch
```

**Recommendation:** Option 1 - Buy the domain now ($12), set up email forwarding to your Gmail. Looks professional immediately.

## 🎴 Business Card Strategy (For Events)

### **What to Include:**
- **Name** + "Full-Stack Developer" or "Software Architect"
- **Website QR Code** → Lands on homepage with "Book Call" CTA
- **Email** (business-style)
- **LinkedIn QR Code** or URL
- **Tagline:** "Custom SaaS • AI Integration • Enterprise Automation"

### **What NOT to Include:**
- ❌ Phone number (unless you want calls)
- ❌ Physical address (not needed for remote dev)
- ❌ Multiple social links (keeps it clean)

### **QR Code Options:**
1. **Primary:** Homepage URL (best for conversions)
2. **Secondary:** LinkedIn profile (best for networking)
3. **Both:** One on each side of card
